Use when the user wants to add page transitions, animate route changes, create shared element animations, or asks about animating between UI states in React without third-party animation libraries.

# React View Transitions

Animate between UI states using the browser's native `document.startViewTransition`. Declare *what* with `<ViewTransition>`, trigger *when* with `startTransition` / `useDeferredValue` / `Suspense`, control *how* with CSS classes. Unsupported browsers skip animations gracefully.

## When to Animate

Every `<ViewTransition>` should communicate a spatial relationship or continuity. If you can't articulate what it communicates, don't add it.

| Priority | Pattern | What it communicates |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Shared element** (`name`) | "Same thing — going deeper" |
| 2 | **Suspense reveal** | "Data loaded" |
| 3 | **List identity** (per-item `key`) | "Same items, new arrangement" |
| 4 | **State change** (`enter`/`exit`) | "Something appeared/disappeared" |
| 5 | **Route change** (layout-level) | "Going to a new place" |

## Core Concepts

### The `<ViewTransition>` Component

```jsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

<ViewTransition>
  <Component />
</ViewTransition>
```

React auto-assigns a unique `view-transition-name` and calls `document.startViewTransition` behind the scenes. Never call `startViewTransition` yourself.
